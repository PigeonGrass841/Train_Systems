            <p>The danger extends beyond deliberate acts of violence; injuries and deaths also occur when people try to pick up items that have fallen 
            on the tracks, get caught and dragged by a moving train, or descend to the tracks to help other individuals.</p>
            <p>Platform screen doors in stations are one way the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) could provide a safer environment 
            for transit users. The MTA has recently announced a pilot of platform screen doors in three stations.</p>
            <p>Platform screen doors are automatic doors installed between the rails and platforms so that there is limited to no access to the rail.</p>

                <li>Platform Screen Doors (PSD) are full-height automatic doors that are fully-fitted to the ceiling. They protect riders from piston
                effects (Rapid winds that occur when the train is approaching).</li>
                <li>Platform Edge Doors (PED) are like PSDs, but do not reach all the way to the ceiling.</li>
                <li>Automatic Platform Gates (APGs) are shorter than PEDs and are half-height.</li>
                <li>Rope Platform Screen Doors (RPSDs) are a newer type of screen door that slide open vertically. Some operate like garage doors, allowing 
                more flexibility in stopping points for the train.</li>

            <p>Restricting access to the tracks with these technologies has numerous benefits.</p>
            <p>It reduces the number of injuries, suicides, and homicides cases, prevents traumas that conductors and bystanders would otherwise endure, and 
            reduces delays caused by these unfortunate incidents.</p>
            <p>It prevents accidents, especially for people with mobility issues and visually impaired people. Some barrier types help with the cleanliness of 
            the station, as less dust enters the platform and less litter makes it to the tracks, reducing fire hazard. They may prevent gusts felt by passengers 
            when the trains approach the station.</p>
            <p>The real estate on these doors can offer a financial benefit through the placement of advertising, or assist with wayfinding.</p>
